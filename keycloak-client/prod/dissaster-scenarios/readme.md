1. Disaster Recovery Scenarios for Database

Scenario 1: Database Instance or AZ Failure
Aurora automatically fails over to the standby instance in another AZ.
No manual intervention required; ensure applications are configured to retry connections.

Scenario 2: Regional Outage
Use Aurora Global Database for cross-region replication with low-latency reads and fast failover capabilities.
Promote the secondary region as the primary database cluster during outages.

Scenario 3: Data Corruption or Accidental Deletion
Restore from the latest snapshot or use PITR to recover data to a specific point before corruption occurred.
Re-import Keycloak realm configurations from backups if necessary.
